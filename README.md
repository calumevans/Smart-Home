# Smart-Light-Switch

This is a smart home system (in progress) using an ESP8266 as a webserver and Arduino Nanos as nodes controlling devices. They are controlled wirelessly from the webserver using XBee modules.

Light Switch:
The light switch using a linear accuator for a servo motor and an ESP8266 acting as a webserver. There is an Android app for turning the light on and off. The Android app was build using MIT App Inventor, it is very basic but it does the job
The linear actuator used is modified from one found at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3170748
