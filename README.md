# Smart-Light-Switch
This is a light switch using a linear accuator for a servo motor and an ESP8266 acting as a webserver. There is an Android app for turning the light on and off.

-the Android app was build using MIT App Inventor, it is very basic but it does the job
-this is very similar to the smart door lock, eventually they will be put into one app when everything is working perfectly
-the linear actuator used is modified from one found at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3170748
